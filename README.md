# version-comparison
This Laravel package compares two version strings and gives the Boolean result. This package also resolves version expressions like (($v > 1.24.0) &amp;&amp; ($v &lt; 1.25.1.0)) || ($v == 1.26 || $v == 1.27) where $v must be substituted with the version number to be compared.
Hence the package can be used for version expressions evaluation.
